# **T25 Analogs**

## Repository

The repository contains the virtual dendrimer library as well as the code used to generate the plots in the manuscript: "An intrinsically disordered antimicrobial peptide dendrimer from stereorandomized virtual screening". To run the Jupyter Notebook "T25analogs.ipynb", make sure that you are using a virtual environment with Python 3.6 or 3.7 if you want to generate the interactive plots.

### **data**

The directory contains all the data required to run the jupyter notebook: 

- 39_2018.xlsx: List of 39 compounds synthesized in 2018
- 64_2021.xlsx: List of 64 compounds synthesized in 2021
- CBD_64.csv: List of 64 compounds synthesized in 2021 containing SMILES and MXFP descriptors
- [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6957034.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6957034)

Please download the virtual library file from the Zenodo repository and add it to the data directory 
 

### **mxfp**

Contains the code to calculate the Macromolecule Extended Fingerprint (MXFP).

### **pdga**

Contains functions to handle peptide dendrimer sequences. These functions are borrowed from our Peptide Design Genetic Algorithm (PDGA) tool.

### **plots**

Contains all the plots generated with the Jupyter Notebook.
